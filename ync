CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
       With no arguments, shows the status of existing submodules. Several subcommands are available to
       perform operations on the submodules.

       add [-b <branch>] [-f|--force] [--name <name>] [--reference <repository>] [--depth <depth>] [--]
       <repository> [<path>]
           Add the given repository as a submodule at the given path to the changeset to be committed next to
           the current project: the current project is termed the "superproject".

           <repository> is the URL of the new submodule’s origin repository. This may be either an absolute
           URL, or (if it begins with ./ or ../), the location relative to the superproject’s default remote
           repository (Please note that to specify a repository _f_o_o_._g_i_t which is located right next to a
           superproject _b_a_r_._g_i_t, you’ll have to use ....//ffoooo..ggiitt instead of ..//ffoooo..ggiitt - as one might expect when
           following the rules for relative URLs - because the evaluation of relative URLs in Git is identical
           to that of relative directories).

           The default remote is the remote of the remote-tracking branch of the current branch. If no such
           remote-tracking branch exists or the HEAD is detached, "origin" is assumed to be the default
           remote. If the superproject doesn’t have a default remote configured the superproject is its own
           authoritative upstream and the current working directory is used instead.

           The optional argument <path> is the relative location for the cloned submodule to exist in the
           superproject. If <path> is not given, the canonical part of the source repository is used ("repo"
           for "/path/to/repo.git" and "foo" for "host.xz:foo/.git"). If <path> exists and is already a valid
           Git repository, then it is staged for commit without cloning. The <path> is also used as the
           submodule’s logical name in its configuration entries unless ----nnaammee is used to specify a logical
           name.

           The given URL is recorded into ..ggiittmmoodduulleess for use by subsequent users cloning the superproject. If
           the URL is given relative to the superproject’s repository, the presumption is the superproject and
           submodule repositories will be kept together in the same relative location, and only the
           superproject’s URL needs to be provided. git-submodule will correctly locate the submodule using
           the relative URL in ..ggiittmmoodduulleess.

       status [--cached] [--recursive] [--] [<path>...]
           Show the status of the submodules. This will print the SHA-1 of the currently checked out commit
           for each submodule, along with the submodule path and the output of _g_i_t _d_e_s_c_r_i_b_e for the SHA-1.
           Each SHA-1 will possibly be prefixed with -- if the submodule is not initialized, ++ if the currently
           checked out submodule commit does not match the SHA-1 found in the index of the containing
           repository and UU if the submodule has merge conflicts.

           If ----ccaacchheedd is specified, this command will instead print the SHA-1 recorded in the superproject
           for each submodule.

           If ----rreeccuurrssiivvee is specified, this command will recurse into nested submodules, and show their
           status as well.

           If you are only interested in changes of the currently initialized submodules with respect to the
           commit recorded in the index or the HEAD, ggiitt--ssttaattuuss(1) and ggiitt--ddiiffff(1) will provide that
           information too (and can also report changes to a submodule’s work tree).

       init [--] [<path>...]
           Initialize the submodules recorded in the index (which were added and committed elsewhere) by
           setting ssuubbmmoodduullee..$$nnaammee..uurrll in .git/config. It uses the same setting from ..ggiittmmoodduulleess as a
           template. If the URL is relative, it will be resolved using the default remote. If there is no
           default remote, the current repository will be assumed to be upstream.

           Optional <path> arguments limit which submodules will be initialized. If no path is specified and
           submodule.active has been configured, submodules configured to be active will be initialized,
           otherwise all submodules are initialized.

           When present, it will also copy the value of ssuubbmmoodduullee..$$nnaammee..uuppddaattee. This command does not alter
           existing information in .git/config. You can then customize the submodule clone URLs in .git/config
           for your local setup and proceed to ggiitt ssuubbmmoodduullee uuppddaattee; you can also just use ggiitt ssuubbmmoodduullee
           uuppddaattee ----iinniitt without the explicit _i_n_i_t step if you do not intend to customize any submodule
           locations.

           See the add subcommand for the definition of default remote.

       deinit [-f|--force] (--all|[--] <path>...)
           Unregister the given submodules, i.e. remove the whole ssuubbmmoodduullee..$$nnaammee section from .git/config
           together with their work tree. Further calls to ggiitt ssuubbmmoodduullee uuppddaattee, ggiitt ssuubbmmoodduullee ffoorreeaacchh and ggiitt
           ssuubbmmoodduullee ssyynncc will skip any unregistered submodules until they are initialized again, so use this
           command if you don’t want to have a local checkout of the submodule in your working tree anymore.

           When the command is run without pathspec, it errors out, instead of deinit-ing everything, to
           prevent mistakes.

           If ----ffoorrccee is specified, the submodule’s working tree will be removed even if it contains local
           modifications.

           If you really want to remove a submodule from the repository and commit that use ggiitt--rrmm(1) instead.
           See ggiittssuubbmmoodduulleess(7) for removal options.

       update [--init] [--remote] [-N|--no-fetch] [--[no-]recommend-shallow] [-f|--force]
       [--checkout|--rebase|--merge] [--reference <repository>] [--depth <depth>] [--recursive] [--jobs <n>]
       [--[no-]single-branch] [--filter <filter spec>] [--] [<path>...]
           Update the registered submodules to match what the superproject expects by cloning missing
           submodules, fetching missing commits in submodules and updating the working tree of the submodules.
           The "updating" can be done in several ways depending on command line options and the value of
           ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..uuppddaattee configuration variable. The command line option takes precedence over the
           configuration variable. If neither is given, a _c_h_e_c_k_o_u_t is performed. The _u_p_d_a_t_e procedures
           supported both from the command line as well as through the ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..uuppddaattee configuration
           are:

           checkout
               the commit recorded in the superproject will be checked out in the submodule on a detached
               HEAD.

               If ----ffoorrccee is specified, the submodule will be checked out (using ggiitt cchheecckkoouutt ----ffoorrccee), even
               if the commit specified in the index of the containing repository already matches the commit
               checked out in the submodule.

           rebase
               the current branch of the submodule will be rebased onto the commit recorded in the
               superproject.

           merge
               the commit recorded in the superproject will be merged into the current branch in the
               submodule.

           The following _u_p_d_a_t_e procedures are only available via the ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..uuppddaattee configuration
           variable:

           custom command
               arbitrary shell command that takes a single argument (the sha1 of the commit recorded in the
               superproject) is executed. When ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..uuppddaattee is set to _!_c_o_m_m_a_n_d, the remainder after
               the exclamation mark is the custom command.

           none
               the submodule is not updated.

           If the submodule is not yet initialized, and you just want to use the setting as stored in
           ..ggiittmmoodduulleess, you can automatically initialize the submodule with the ----iinniitt option.

           If ----rreeccuurrssiivvee is specified, this command will recurse into the registered submodules, and update
           any nested submodules within.

           If ----ffiilltteerr <<ffiilltteerr ssppeecc>> is specified, the given partial clone filter will be applied to the
           submodule. See ggiitt--rreevv--lliisstt(1) for details on filter specifications.

       set-branch (-b|--branch) <branch> [--] <path>, set-branch (-d|--default) [--] <path>
           Sets the default remote tracking branch for the submodule. The ----bbrraanncchh option allows the remote
           branch to be specified. The ----ddeeffaauulltt option removes the submodule.<name>.branch configuration key,
           which causes the tracking branch to default to the remote _H_E_A_D.

       set-url [--] <path> <newurl>
           Sets the URL of the specified submodule to <newurl>. Then, it will automatically synchronize the
           submodule’s new remote URL configuration.

       summary [--cached|--files] [(-n|--summary-limit) <n>] [commit] [--] [<path>...]
           Show commit summary between the given commit (defaults to HEAD) and working tree/index. For a
           submodule in question, a series of commits in the submodule between the given super project commit
           and the index or working tree (switched by ----ccaacchheedd) are shown. If the option ----ffiilleess is given,
           show the series of commits in the submodule between the index of the super project and the working
           tree of the submodule (this option doesn’t allow to use the ----ccaacchheedd option or to provide an
           explicit commit).

           Using the ----ssuubbmmoodduullee==lloogg option with ggiitt--ddiiffff(1) will provide that information too.

       foreach [--recursive] <command>
           Evaluates an arbitrary shell command in each checked out submodule. The command has access to the
           variables $name, $sm_path, $displaypath, $sha1 and $toplevel: $name is the name of the relevant
           submodule section in ..ggiittmmoodduulleess, $sm_path is the path of the submodule as recorded in the
           immediate superproject, $displaypath contains the relative path from the current working directory
           to the submodules root directory, $sha1 is the commit as recorded in the immediate superproject,
           and $toplevel is the absolute path to the top-level of the immediate superproject. Note that to
           avoid conflicts with _$_P_A_T_H on Windows, the _$_p_a_t_h variable is now a deprecated synonym of _$_s_m___p_a_t_h
           variable. Any submodules defined in the superproject but not checked out are ignored by this
           command. Unless given ----qquuiieett, foreach prints the name of each submodule before evaluating the
           command. If ----rreeccuurrssiivvee is given, submodules are traversed recursively (i.e. the given shell
           command is evaluated in nested submodules as well). A non-zero return from the command in any
           submodule causes the processing to terminate. This can be overridden by adding _|_| _: to the end of
           the command.

           As an example, the command below will show the path and currently checked out commit for each
           submodule:

               git submodule foreach 'echo $sm_path `git rev-parse HEAD`'

       sync [--recursive] [--] [<path>...]
           Synchronizes submodules' remote URL configuration setting to the value specified in ..ggiittmmoodduulleess. It
           will only affect those submodules which already have a URL entry in .git/config (that is the case
           when they are initialized or freshly added). This is useful when submodule URLs change upstream and
           you need to update your local repositories accordingly.

           ggiitt ssuubbmmoodduullee ssyynncc synchronizes all submodules while ggiitt ssuubbmmoodduullee ssyynncc ---- AA synchronizes submodule
           "A" only.

           If ----rreeccuurrssiivvee is specified, this command will recurse into the registered submodules, and sync any
           nested submodules within.

       absorbgitdirs
           If a git directory of a submodule is inside the submodule, move the git directory of the submodule
           into its superproject’s $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//mmoodduulleess path and then connect the git directory and its working
           directory by setting the ccoorree..wwoorrkkttrreeee and adding a .git file pointing to the git directory
           embedded in the superprojects git directory.

           A repository that was cloned independently and later added as a submodule or old setups have the
           submodules git directory inside the submodule instead of embedded into the superprojects git
           directory.

           This command is recursive by default.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -q, --quiet
           Only print error messages.

       --progress
           This option is only valid for add and update commands. Progress status is reported on the standard
           error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This flag forces
           progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

       --all
           This option is only valid for the deinit command. Unregister all submodules in the working tree.

       -b <branch>, --branch <branch>
           Branch of repository to add as submodule. The name of the branch is recorded as
           ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..bbrraanncchh in ..ggiittmmoodduulleess for uuppddaattee ----rreemmoottee. A special value of ..  is used to
           indicate that the name of the branch in the submodule should be the same name as the current branch
           in the current repository. If the option is not specified, it defaults to the remote _H_E_A_D.

       -f, --force
           This option is only valid for add, deinit and update commands. When running add, allow adding an
           otherwise ignored submodule path. When running deinit the submodule working trees will be removed
           even if they contain local changes. When running update (only effective with the checkout
           procedure), throw away local changes in submodules when switching to a different commit; and always
           run a checkout operation in the submodule, even if the commit listed in the index of the containing
           repository matches the commit checked out in the submodule.

       --cached
           This option is only valid for status and summary commands. These commands typically use the commit
           found in the submodule HEAD, but with this option, the commit stored in the index is used instead.

       --files
           This option is only valid for the summary command. This command compares the commit in the index
           with that in the submodule HEAD when this option is used.

       -n, --summary-limit
           This option is only valid for the summary command. Limit the summary size (number of commits shown
           in total). Giving 0 will disable the summary; a negative number means unlimited (the default). This
           limit only applies to modified submodules. The size is always limited to 1 for
           added/deleted/typechanged submodules.

       --remote
           This option is only valid for the update command. Instead of using the superproject’s recorded
           SHA-1 to update the submodule, use the status of the submodule’s remote-tracking branch. The remote
           used is branch’s remote (bbrraanncchh..<<nnaammee>>..rreemmoottee), defaulting to oorriiggiinn. The remote branch used
           defaults to the remote HHEEAADD, but the branch name may be overridden by setting the
           ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..bbrraanncchh option in either ..ggiittmmoodduulleess or ..ggiitt//ccoonnffiigg (with ..ggiitt//ccoonnffiigg taking
           precedence).

           This works for any of the supported update procedures (----cchheecckkoouutt, ----rreebbaassee, etc.). The only change
           is the source of the target SHA-1. For example, ssuubbmmoodduullee uuppddaattee ----rreemmoottee ----mmeerrggee will merge
           upstream submodule changes into the submodules, while ssuubbmmoodduullee uuppddaattee ----mmeerrggee will merge
           superproject gitlink changes into the submodules.

           In order to ensure a current tracking branch state, uuppddaattee ----rreemmoottee fetches the submodule’s remote
           repository before calculating the SHA-1. If you don’t want to fetch, you should use ssuubbmmoodduullee
           uuppddaattee ----rreemmoottee ----nnoo--ffeettcchh.

           Use this option to integrate changes from the upstream subproject with your submodule’s current
           HEAD. Alternatively, you can run ggiitt ppuullll from the submodule, which is equivalent except for the
           remote branch name: uuppddaattee ----rreemmoottee uses the default upstream repository and
           ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..bbrraanncchh, while ggiitt ppuullll uses the submodule’s bbrraanncchh..<<nnaammee>>..mmeerrggee. Prefer
           ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..bbrraanncchh if you want to distribute the default upstream branch with the superproject
           and bbrraanncchh..<<nnaammee>>..mmeerrggee if you want a more native feel while working in the submodule itself.

       -N, --no-fetch
           This option is only valid for the update command. Don’t fetch new objects from the remote site.

       --checkout
           This option is only valid for the update command. Checkout the commit recorded in the superproject
           on a detached HEAD in the submodule. This is the default behavior, the main use of this option is
           to override ssuubbmmoodduullee..$$nnaammee..uuppddaattee when set to a value other than cchheecckkoouutt. If the key
           ssuubbmmoodduullee..$$nnaammee..uuppddaattee is either not explicitly set or set to cchheecckkoouutt, this option is implicit.

       --merge
           This option is only valid for the update command. Merge the commit recorded in the superproject
           into the current branch of the submodule. If this option is given, the submodule’s HEAD will not be
           detached. If a merge failure prevents this process, you will have to resolve the resulting
           conflicts within the submodule with the usual conflict resolution tools. If the key
           ssuubbmmoodduullee..$$nnaammee..uuppddaattee is set to mmeerrggee, this option is implicit.

       --rebase
           This option is only valid for the update command. Rebase the current branch onto the commit
           recorded in the superproject. If this option is given, the submodule’s HEAD will not be detached.
           If a merge failure prevents this process, you will have to resolve these failures with ggiitt--
           rreebbaassee(1). If the key ssuubbmmoodduullee..$$nnaammee..uuppddaattee is set to rreebbaassee, this option is implicit.

       --init
           This option is only valid for the update command. Initialize all submodules for which "git
           submodule init" has not been called so far before updating.

       --name
           This option is only valid for the add command. It sets the submodule’s name to the given string
           instead of defaulting to its path. The name must be valid as a directory name and may not end with
           a _/.

       --reference <repository>
           This option is only valid for add and update commands. These commands sometimes need to clone a
           remote repository. In this case, this option will be passed to the ggiitt--cclloonnee(1) command.

           NNOOTTEE: Do nnoott use this option unless you have read the note for ggiitt--cclloonnee(1)'s ----rreeffeerreennccee,
           ----sshhaarreedd, and ----ddiissssoocciiaattee options carefully.

       --dissociate
           This option is only valid for add and update commands. These commands sometimes need to clone a
           remote repository. In this case, this option will be passed to the ggiitt--cclloonnee(1) command.

           NNOOTTEE: see the NOTE for the ----rreeffeerreennccee option.

       --recursive
           This option is only valid for foreach, update, status and sync commands. Traverse submodules
           recursively. The operation is performed not only in the submodules of the current repo, but also in
           any nested submodules inside those submodules (and so on).

       --depth
           This option is valid for add and update commands. Create a _s_h_a_l_l_o_w clone with a history truncated
           to the specified number of revisions. See ggiitt--cclloonnee(1)

       --[no-]recommend-shallow
           This option is only valid for the update command. The initial clone of a submodule will use the
           recommended ssuubbmmoodduullee..<<nnaammee>>..sshhaallllooww as provided by the ..ggiittmmoodduulleess file by default. To ignore the
           suggestions use ----nnoo--rreeccoommmmeenndd--sshhaallllooww.

       -j <n>, --jobs <n>
           This option is only valid for the update command. Clone new submodules in parallel with as many
           jobs. Defaults to the ssuubbmmoodduullee..ffeettcchhJJoobbss option.

       --[no-]single-branch
           This option is only valid for the update command. Clone only one branch during update: HEAD or one
           specified by --branch.

       <path>...
           Paths to submodule(s). When specified this will restrict the command to only operate on the
           submodules found at the specified paths. (This argument is required with add).

FFIILLEESS
       When initializing submodules, a ..ggiittmmoodduulleess file in the top-level directory of the containing
       repository is used to find the url of each submodule. This file should be formatted in the same way as
       $$GGIITT__DDIIRR//ccoonnffiigg. The key to each submodule url is "submodule.$name.url". See ggiittmmoodduulleess(5) for details.
