## FAQ

- What's Indiebase?  
  Indiebase is a self-hosted platform explicitly designed for indie hackers or teams. Providing financial services and BaaS. It is similar to a private OpenCollective + Firebase. The initial purpose of Indiebase was to serve [deskbtm](https://deskbtm.com), used for managing [Nawb](https://nawb.deskbtm.com/), [PlugKit](https://github.com/deskbtm-plugkit/plugkit), etc.

  Indiebase Community is the FOSS version of Indiebase. It provides basic functions like financial services and basic BaaS.
- What's Indiebase Pro?  
  Indiebase Pro is the paid version of Indiebase. It provides more functions.
- Does Indiebase provide an online service?  
  Nope, Indiebase only provides the self-hosted service. Ensure the functionality while making it capable of running on low-configured server environments as much as possible.

## Profits

- For indie developers/small teams: Let passionate developers collaborate on profitable independent projects during their spare time. Reducing development costs through BaaS.
- For programming geeks: By discovering projects you love in Indiebase, contributing code, and earning rewards from it.
